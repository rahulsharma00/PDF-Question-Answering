# PDF-Question-Answering
AskYourPDF is a powerful Python application built with Streamlit and LangChain, designed to make PDF documents interactive and easily queryable. This project leverages LangChain's capabilities, including text splitting, embeddings, and vector stores, to enhance the user experience when working with PDFs. Whether you want to perform a similarity search, retrieve top-k chunks, or submit questions to language models like OpenAI or Falcon-7B, AskYourPDF streamlines the process with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

### Note - You need OpenAI API and HuggingFace API to run this application

## How it works
The application reads the PDF and splits the text into smaller chunks that can be then fed into a LLM. It uses OpenAI embeddings to create vector representations of the chunks. The application then finds the chunks that are semantically similar to the question that the user asked and feeds those chunks to the LLM to generate a response.

The application uses Streamlit to create the GUI and Langchain to deal with the LLM.

## Usage
To use the application, run the respective  `.py`  files with the streamlit CLI (after having installed streamlit):

`streamlit run app.py`

### Falcon API currently experiences extended question-answering response times, averaging between 10-15 minutes. This delay may be attributed to potential server overloads on the Falcon API side.

## Note There are 4 files in the folder

### 1. `gpt_falcon.py`

This helps you choose between the openai and the falcon llm to do pdf question answering. Choose one of the llm and then upload the file on which you want to ask questions on. Here is the output picture:

### 2. `gpt_with_chunks.py`
This code provides the following output:
1. **Chunks with Similar Context/Meaning as the Question**: Provides chunks of text identified with context or meaning similar to the user's question.
2. **Top 3 Chunks Similar to the Question**: Displays the three most relevant text chunks related to the user's question.
3. **Answer from the LLM (Language Model)**: Outputs the question's answer generated by the Language Model.
4. **Determining 'k' Value for Each Chunk Retrieval**: Presents the 'k' value, representing the length of each retrieved text chunk.

### 3. `gpt.py`
This code consists of the `openai` llm to do question answering. This does **not** consists of answering chunks with similar meaning or determining the k value of each chunks.Here is the output picture:

### 4. `falcon.py`
This code consists of the `falcon-7b-instruct` llm to do question answering. This does **not** consists of answering chunks with similar meaning or determining the k value of each chunks.
